Important Notes:

1) when you create an IOTDB object using 'iotdb.iot()'
   the initial settings will be read from the file 
   '$PROJECT/$FILE_IOTDB' or if that's not fouund
   '$HOME/.iotdb/iotdb.json'

   Feel free to edit this file _OR_ you can add a 
   dictionary argument to the first call of
   'iotdb.iot()'

2) you can rerun 'iotdb-control' on this project. It will
   not destroy any existing files, data or settings

3) your starter code is in '$PROJECT/$FILE_JS'. If this
   already exists, we did not overwrite it!
