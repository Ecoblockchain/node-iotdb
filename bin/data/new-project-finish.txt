Important Notes:

1) when you create an IOTDB object using 'new iotdb.IOT()', 
   the initial settings will be read from the file 
   '$PROJECT/$FILE_IOTDB'. 

   Feel free to edit this file _OR_ you can add a 
   dictionary argument to 'iotdb.IOT()' to override

2) you can rerun 'iotdb-control' on this project. It will
   not destroy any existing files, data or settings

3) your starter code is in '$PROJECT/$FILE_JS'. If this
   already exists, we did not overwrite it!
